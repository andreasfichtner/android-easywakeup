# Easy WakeUp
This is a simple app to allow some common sensors to wake up Android devices. It currently supports
* Proximity sensor: Wake up if it detects less than 5 cm distance
* Light sensor: Wake up if lighty intensity suddenly drops to less than a tenth of previous readings
* Acceleration sensor: Wake up when the device is moving more than before (implementation is not very sophisticated at the moment).

# What for?
I wrote this app for my Nexus 7 tablet which I use on a stand. It does not have a proximity sensor and there is no way to activate it one-handed without pushing it from the stand.
